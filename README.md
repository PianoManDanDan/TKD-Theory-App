This is an ongoing project that uses the NativeScript framework to create a cross platform mobile app (android and iOS) to help users learn Tae Kwon-Do theory.

The project uses XML to determine the layout and positioning of items on the screen, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for functionality and logic.

So far, the main home screen of the app and the About page have been completed, as well as the app's icon on mobile screens. Logic and pages for the theory of all of the belts are yet to be done.

To install the app:
1. Install Nativescript using this [link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript)
2. Navigate to the cloned repository location.
3. Type `tns run <platform>` into the command line, with "`<platform>`" being replaced with either "android" or "ios". If a mobile device is plugged into your computer, the app will automatically be downloaded onto your mobile device. **If trying to install the app onto an iPhone, your mobile device must be plugged into a computer running MacOS.**
